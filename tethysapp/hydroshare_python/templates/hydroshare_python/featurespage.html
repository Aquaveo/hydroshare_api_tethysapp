<h1>Limitations of the app:</h1>

<p>A few features found in the page of HydroShare are not present here in this tethys app. These limitations are due to two factors on which I would be expanding further below. </p>
<p>The factors being, <b>a) features that are very similar to the ones already present on the page</b> and <b>b) the restclient is yet to bring out api to support some features</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Features yet to be added to the restclient</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<p>Adding users as contributors</p>
<p>Different ways to filter resources</p>
<p>Making groups and communities in HydroShare</p>
<p>'Sort by' reference feature</p>
</ul>
<p>The above mentioned features are present in the HydroShare page but are not available in this tethys app as there is no api yet to support their functioning.</p>
<p>However, the page is updated periodically and there will be support added for more features in the near future.</p>
<p>Here is the link for the restclient - <b><a href="https://hs-restclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">'HydroShare REST API Python client library'</a></b></p>

<h3> Features skipped that were very similar to the existent app features:</h3>
