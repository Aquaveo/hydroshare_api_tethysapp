  <img src="{% static 'hydroshare_python/images/deleteresource.jpeg'%}" alt="Resource ID" height="200">

  <p>As shown above this feature in the app is to delete a Resource from your profile. The action is done to delete any unnecessary resources created. This is a permanent action which would delete ALL files in the resource and it cannot be retrieved again. So be careful! But this feature works smoothly without any glitches, just try copying the resource id from the HTTP hyperlink when you open your resource in Hydroshare. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The way you could go about performing this function is by following the instructions below:</p>
  <h3>Step 1: Sign into HydroShare using your credentials</h3>
  <form id="add-dam-form" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    
    {% csrf_token %}

    <p>In the boxes below you enter your HydroShare username and its password. If you have to make an HydroShare account, <a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/sign-up/?next=">click here</a>.</p>
    {% gizmo username_input %}
    {% gizmo password_input %}
  <p></p>
  <h3>Step 2: Enter in the Resource ID and delete the Resource</h3>
    <p>The resource Id is a unique identifier for every resource on Hydroshare. You can findit by browsing to your HydroShare resource copying the ID from the URL. Like for example, this is an example hyperlink https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/08c6e88adaa647cd9bb28e5d619178e0/ from which the 32 letter combination at the end is called the resource id. And so the resource id from the example hyperlink is <mark>08c6e88adaa647cd9bb28e5d619178e0</mark> </p>
    <img src="{% static 'hydroshare_python/images/resourceid.jpeg'%}" alt="Resource ID" height="30">
    <p></p>
    {% gizmo resourcein_input %}
    <p></p>
    {% gizmo delete_button %}
    

  </form>

            hs.deleteResource(resourcein)
            messages.error(request, "Resource deleted successfully")
        if has_errors:    
            messages.error(request, "Please fix errors.")
